# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The LLM RAG Contract Analyzer is a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze legal contracts. The system will enable users to upload contracts, ask questions about contract terms, identify key clauses, and receive intelligent analysis powered by AI while maintaining accuracy through document retrieval.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want to upload contract documents to the system, so that I can analyze them using AI-powered tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a contract file THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, DOCX, and TXT file formats
2. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the file size is under 50MB
3. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process and store the document for analysis
4. IF an invalid file format is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display an error message with supported formats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask natural language questions about my contract, so that I can quickly understand specific terms and clauses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a question about an uploaded contract THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant contract sections using RAG
2. WHEN relevant sections are found THEN the system SHALL generate an AI-powered response using the LLM
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL cite specific sections or page numbers from the contract
4. IF no relevant information is found THEN the system SHALL inform the user that the question cannot be answered from the contract

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want the system to automatically identify key contract clauses, so that I can quickly review important terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contract is uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically identify common clause types (termination, payment, liability, etc.)
2. WHEN key clauses are identified THEN the system SHALL extract and summarize each clause type
3. WHEN displaying identified clauses THEN the system SHALL provide the exact text location within the contract
4. IF standard clauses are missing THEN the system SHALL flag potential gaps in the contract

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my analysis history, so that I can reference previous contract reviews and questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes contract analysis THEN the system SHALL save the session with timestamp
2. WHEN a user accesses history THEN the system SHALL display previous contracts, questions, and responses
3. WHEN viewing historical analysis THEN the system SHALL allow users to re-open previous contract sessions
4. WHEN managing history THEN the system SHALL allow users to delete old analysis sessions
